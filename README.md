# Bond

A front-end component library and framework based on PostCSS and Atomic Design.

#### Prerequisites

* Node
* Brew
* Yarn

#### Getting Started

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. `cd my-project`
3. Clone or download Bond.
4. `cd assets`
5. `npm run bond`
6. Customize components to your needs.

Bond provides you with a "kitchen sink" of components within `index.html`. All components, including their various states, are included. It is best to create your own HTML files for each of your project's pages and pick and choose which components you need from `index.html`.

For more detailed information, I encourage you to check out the complete [Bond Docs](http://bond.codeandmortar.com/docs).
